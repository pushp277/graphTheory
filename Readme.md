# The Repo contains all the important Algorithms in Graph Theory

#### We are going to use Jave 17 to implement all the Algorithms one my one

#### Graph is a fucntion of Node and Vertex
#### Graph can be represented in different ways like
##### Edge List, 
##### Adjecency List, and
##### Adjecency Matrix

#### Different Categories of Graphs are

##### DAG -> Directed Acyclic Graph
##### Bipartite Graph 
##### Complete Graph
